# Welcome to Vantage Compute Documentation

Vantage is a comprehensive High Performance Computing platform that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of computational workloads across diverse infrastructure environments.

## Quick Start

Get started with Vantage in minutes:

1. **[Sign Up](/getting-started/getting-started-sign-up)** - Create your Vantage account
2. **[Connect a Cluster](/platform/clusters/)** - Add your compute resources
3. **[Submit Your First Job](/platform/jobs)** - Run computational workloads

## Platform Overview

### [Jobs](/platform/jobs)
Manage computational workloads with templates, scripts, and submissions. Create reusable job configurations and track execution across your infrastructure.

### [Clusters](/platform/clusters)
Deploy and manage HPC clusters across on-premises, cloud, and partner environments. Scale resources dynamically based on workload demands.

### [Storage](/platform/storage)
Integrate with various storage solutions including cloud storage, on-premises systems, and distributed file systems for your computational data.

### [Remote Desktops](/platform/remote-desktops)
Access your computational environments through secure remote desktop connections with full GUI support.

### [Notebooks](/platform/notebooks)
Interactive development environments including Jupyter notebooks and VS Code integration for data science and research workflows.

### [Compute Providers](/platform/compute-providers)
Connect to diverse compute resources including AWS, Azure, GCP, and specialized HPC partners for optimal cost and performance.

### [Teams](/platform/teams)
Collaborate with team members through shared resources, role-based access control, and project management capabilities.

### [Licenses](/platform/licenses)
Manage commercial software licenses across your HPC infrastructure with support for FlexLM, RLM, LMX, and other license servers.

## Developer Tools

### [CLI](/cli)
