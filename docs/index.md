title: Welcome to Vantage Compute Documentation
description: High Performance Computing platform for modern workloads
---

Vantage is a comprehensive High Performance Computing platform that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of computational workloads across diverse infrastructure environments.

## Quick Start

The goal of the quick start documentation is to guide a new user into the platform and help familiarize with a few of the core
primitives of the Vantage platform.

These guides

Deploy a slurm cluster, launch a notebook, and submit a job in < 5 minutes using [`multipass`](https://canonical.com/multipass)
