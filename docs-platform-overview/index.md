Vantage Platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools for High Performance Computing, enabling you to deploy, manage, and scale computational workloads across diverse infrastructure environments.

## Platform Components

### [Jobs](/platform/jobs)

Manage computational workloads with templates, scripts, and submissions. Create reusable job configurations and track execution across your infrastructure.

- **Job Templates** - Standardize common computational workflows
- **Job Scripts** - Custom execution scripts with version control
- **Job Submissions** - Submit and monitor job runs in real-time

### [Clusters](/platform/clusters)

Deploy and manage HPC clusters across on-premises, cloud, and partner environments. Scale resources dynamically based on workload demands.

- **Multi-Cloud Support** - AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid deployments
- **Auto-Scaling** - Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **Cluster Templates** - Pre-configured cluster configurations

### [Storage](/platform/storage)

Integrate with various storage solutions including cloud storage, on-premises systems, and distributed file systems for your computational data.

- **Multi-Storage Support** - S3, Azure Blob, GCS, NFS, and more
- **Data Management** - Automated data transfer and synchronization
- **Performance Optimization** - High-throughput data access

### [Remote Desktops](/platform/remote-desktops)

Access your computational environments through secure remote desktop connections with full GUI support for interactive workflows.

- **Secure Access** - VPN-free remote desktop connections
- **GUI Applications** - Full desktop environment for visualization
- **Session Management** - Persistent sessions and resource allocation

### [Notebooks](/platform/notebooks)

Interactive development environments including Jupyter notebooks and VS Code integration for data science and research workflows.

- **Jupyter Integration** - Native Jupyter notebook support
- **VS Code Support** - Cloud-based VS Code environments
- **Collaborative Features** - Share notebooks and environments

### [Compute Providers](/platform/compute-providers)

Connect to diverse compute resources including public clouds, on-premises infrastructure, and specialized HPC partners.

- **Public Clouds** - AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform
- **On-Premises** - Private data centers and edge computing
- **HPC Partners** - Specialized high-performance computing providers

### [Teams](/platform/teams)

Collaborate with team members through shared resources, role-based access control, and project management capabilities.

- **Role-Based Access** - Fine-grained permission management
- **Resource Sharing** - Share clusters, storage, and applications
- **Project Organization** - Organize work by teams and projects

### [Licenses](/platform/licenses)

Manage commercial software licenses across your HPC infrastructure with support for FlexLM, RLM, LMX, and other license servers.

- **License Servers** - FlexLM, RLM, LMX, and custom solutions
- **Usage Monitoring** - Track license utilization and costs
- **High Availability** - Redundant license server configurations

## Common Use Cases
