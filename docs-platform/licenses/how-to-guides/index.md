## License Server Categories

Vantage supports two distinct categories of license server deployment; User-Hosted and Vantage-Hosted. Each with unique advantages and use cases:

### User-Hosted License Servers

Traditional license server deployment where your organization manages the license server infrastructure within your own environment (on-premises, private cloud, or your own cloud accounts).

- **Full Control**: Complete administrative control over license server configuration, security, and access policies
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage your current license server investments and configurations
- **Custom Integration**: Direct integration with existing authentication systems, monitoring tools, and network infrastructure
- **Compliance Requirements**: Ideal for organizations with strict data sovereignty or regulatory compliance requirements
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Mix of on-premises and cloud-based license servers as needed

### Vantage-Hosted License Servers

Fully managed license server deployment where Vantage operates the license infrastructure within Kubernetes clusters associated with your Vantage organization.

- **Managed Service**: Vantage handles all server deployment, maintenance, updates, and monitoring
- **Rapid Deployment**: Quick setup with minimal configuration required
- **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on license demand and usage patterns
- **Integrated Analytics**: Deep integration with Vantage License Manager for comprehensive insights
- **Multi-tenant Security**: Isolated environments with enterprise-grade security controls
- **Global Distribution**: License servers deployed across multiple regions for optimal performance

- **Best Practices**: Recommended configurations and optimization strategies

## Deployment Model Comparison

| Aspect | User-Hosted | Vantage-Hosted |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Administrative Control** | Full control over all aspects | Vantage manages infrastructure |
| **Setup Complexity** | Manual installation and configuration | Automated deployment |
| **Maintenance** | Your team handles updates and patches | Vantage manages all maintenance |
| **Scalability** | Manual scaling planning required | Automatic scaling based on demand |
| **Integration Effort** | Manual vantage-agent configuration | Built-in integration |
| **Time to Production** | Days to weeks depending on complexity | Minutes to hours |
| **Cost Model** | Hardware + license + operational costs | Service-based pricing |
| **Customization** | Unlimited customization options | Standardized configurations |
| **Security** | Your security policies and controls | Vantage enterprise security standards |
| **Compliance** | Full compliance responsibility | Shared compliance model |

## Adding License Servers to Vantage

### User-Hosted License Server Integration

When using your own license server infrastructure, integration with Vantage involves:

**1. License Server Preparation**:
- Install and configure your chosen license server technology
- Set up license files and vendor daemons
- Configure network access and firewall rules
- Implement high availability if required

**2. Vantage Agent Deployment**:
- Install the vantage-agent on systems that can access your license servers
- Configure agent to monitor specific license server endpoints
- Set up authentication and secure communication channels
- Configure data collection intervals and monitoring scope

**3. Vantage Platform Configuration**:
- Register license servers in your Vantage organization
- Configure access policies and user permissions
- Set up monitoring dashboards and alerting rules
- Integrate with job scheduling and resource allocation

**Benefits**:
- Leverage existing license server investments
- Maintain complete control over license policies
- Integrate with existing enterprise systems
- Support complex multi-site deployments

**Considerations**:
- Requires in-house license server expertise
- Ongoing maintenance and support responsibility
- Manual high availability configuration
- Network connectivity requirements between sites

### Vantage-Hosted License Server Deployment

When using Vantage-managed license servers, the process involves:

**1. Service Provisioning**:
- Select license server technology and configuration template
- Specify geographic regions and availability requirements
- Define initial license allocation and scaling policies
- Configure integration with Vantage job scheduling

**2. Kubernetes Deployment**:
- Vantage automatically deploys license server containers
- Sets up persistent storage for license data and logs
- Configures load balancing and service discovery
- Implements monitoring and health checks

**3. License File Integration**:
- Upload license files through Vantage console
- Automatic license validation and activation
- Centralized license renewal and update management
- Real-time license usage tracking and analytics

**4. Advanced Features**:
- Geographic license distribution for global teams
- Automatic failover and disaster recovery
- Cost optimization through usage-based scaling
- Integration with Vantage identity and access management

**Benefits**:
- Zero infrastructure management overhead
- Built-in high availability and disaster recovery
- Automatic scaling and performance optimization
- Deep integration with Vantage analytics and cost management

**Considerations**:
- Requires trust in Vantage-managed infrastructure
- Standardized configurations may limit customization
- Dependency on Vantage service availability
- Data residency considerations for some compliance requirements
