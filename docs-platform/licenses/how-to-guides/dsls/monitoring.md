## Token Usage Monitoring

### Real-Time Token Tracking

DSLS token allocation provides detailed insights into license utilization:

```bash
# Monitor current token usage
dsls-status --tokens --real-time

# Example output:
# Product                  | Allocated | In Use | Available | Peak Usage
# -------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------
# ABAQUS_STANDARD         | 50        | 32     | 18        | 45 (95%)
# ABAQUS_EXPLICIT         | 30        | 8      | 22        | 28 (93%)
# CATIA_V6_DESIGN         | 100       | 67     | 33        | 95 (95%)
# SOLIDWORKS_PREMIUM      | 25        | 15     | 10        | 23 (92%)
# TOSCA_STRUCTURE         | 40        | 12     | 28        | 35 (88%)
# -------------------------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------
# TOTAL TOKENS            | 245       | 134    | 111       | 226 (92%)
```

### Token Pool Analytics

```bash
# Analyze token pool efficiency
vantage-agent analyze dsls --token-pools

# Product-specific usage patterns
vantage-agent report dsls \
  --product abaqus_standard \
  --timeframe "last 30 days" \
  --breakdown hourly
```

### Academic vs Commercial Tracking

```bash
# Separate academic and commercial usage
dsls-monitor --academic-analysis

# Academic token utilization
# - Student Pool: 200 tokens (150 used, 75% utilization)
# - Faculty Pool: 50 tokens (35 used, 70% utilization)  
# - Research Pool: 100 tokens (60 used, 60% utilization)
# 
# Commercial Pool: 500 tokens (380 used, 76% utilization)
```

## User and Session Monitoring

### Active Session Tracking

Monitor real-time user sessions across all DS products:

```bash
# Current active sessions
dsls-sessions --active --detailed

# Session details:
# User: john.smith@company.com
# Product: ABAQUS_STANDARD
# Tokens: 8
# Start Time: 2024-01-15 09:15:22
# Duration: 2h 45m
# Host: workstation-142.lab.company.com
# Project: turbine_analysis_v3
# License Features: [solver, cae, advanced_materials]
```

### Usage Patterns Analysis

```bash
# User behavior analytics
vantage-agent analyze dsls --user-patterns

# Peak usage identification
vantage-agent report dsls \
  --peak-usage \
  --breakdown "hourly,daily,weekly"

# Department usage analysis
vantage-agent report dsls \
  --group-by department \
  --products "abaqus,catia,solidworks"
```

### Queue and Contention Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor license queues
dsls-queue --monitor --alerts

# Queue analytics:
# Product: CATIA_V6_DESIGN
# Queued Users: 5
# Average Wait Time: 12 minutes
# Longest Wait: 45 minutes (user: jane.doe@company.com)
# Queue Priority: [faculty, graduate_students, undergrad]
```

# - Academic priority: High during class hours
# - Research priority: High during off-hours
# - Faculty override: Always available
```

### Seasonal Optimization

```bash
# Implement seasonal optimization
vantage-agent schedule dsls --seasonal-optimization

# Fall/Spring Semester: +30% academic allocation
# Summer Session: +50% research allocation
# Winter Break: Maintenance mode (minimal allocation)
# Finals Week: +100% academic buffer
```

## Next Steps

With comprehensive DSLS monitoring configured, proceed to:
