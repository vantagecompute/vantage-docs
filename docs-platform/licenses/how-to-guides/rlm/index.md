     --port 5053 \
     --vendor siemens \
     --name "Siemens RLM License Server"
   ```

2. **Verify Connection**
   ```bash
   vantage licenses test rlm-server
   ```

3. **Enable Monitoring**
   ```bash
   vantage licenses monitor rlm-server --enable
   ```

4. **Access Dashboard**
   Navigate to the Vantage web interface and view real-time license usage under "License Management"

### Configuration for Jobs

Configure Vantage jobs to use RLM licenses:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch.vantage.com/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: starccm-simulation
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: starccm
        image: vantage/siemens-starccm:2023.1
        resources:
          requests:
            licenses:
              rlm/STARCCM: 4  # Request 4 STAR-CCM+ licenses
          limits:
            licenses:
              rlm/STARCCM: 8  # Maximum 8 licenses
        env:
        - name: RLM_LICENSE
          value: "5053@license-server.company.com"
```

## Architecture Overview

### License Server Components

RLM consists of several key components:

- **rlm**: Main license server daemon
- **Web interface**: Browser-based administration tool (typically port 5054)
- **ISV server**: Vendor-specific license server component
- **License file**: Contains license definitions and server configuration
- **Client libraries**: Applications link to RLM client libraries

## License Types and Features

### License Models

- **Floating licenses**: Shared across multiple users with dynamic allocation
- **Node-locked licenses**: Tied to specific hardware for dedicated workstations
- **Roaming licenses**: Allow offline operation with temporary checkout
- **Borrowed licenses**: Extended checkout periods for mobile workers

### Advanced Features

- **License pools**: Group related licenses for efficient sharing
- **User groups**: Define access controls and priority levels
- **Time-based restrictions**: Configure usage windows and scheduling
- **Geographic restrictions**: Control license access by location

### Example License File Structure

```bash
# RLM license file structure
HOST server1 ANY 5053
