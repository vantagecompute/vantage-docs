# FlexLM License Management with Vantage

FlexLM (Flexible License Manager) is one of the most widely used floating license systems in engineering and scientific computing. Vantage provides comprehensive FlexLM integration through the Vantage License Manager, offering centralized monitoring, automatic failover, and advanced analytics for your FlexLM infrastructure.

## What is FlexLM?

FlexLM is a floating license management system that allows software licenses to be shared across multiple users and systems. Instead of binding licenses to specific machines, FlexLM enables:

- **Floating licenses**: Multiple users can share a pool of licenses
- **License borrowing**: Users can temporarily check out licenses for offline use
- **Usage tracking**: Detailed monitoring of license utilization
- **High availability**: Redundant server configurations for continuous service

## Vantage License Manager Integration

Vantage License Manager provides a modern interface and advanced capabilities for managing FlexLM servers:

### Centralized Dashboard

The Vantage License Manager dashboard provides:

- **Real-time usage monitoring**: Live view of license consumption across all applications
- **User analytics**: Track individual and team license usage patterns
- **Cost optimization**: Identify underutilized licenses and optimize allocations
- **Historical trends**: Analyze usage patterns over time for capacity planning

### Automated License Management

- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically detect and configure FlexLM servers
- **Health monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with automatic alerts
- **Failover support**: Seamless failover between redundant license servers
- **Queue management**: Intelligent license queuing for high-demand scenarios

### Enterprise Integration

- **SSO integration**: Single sign-on with your organization's identity provider
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for license administration
- **API access**: RESTful APIs for integration with existing workflows
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for compliance requirements

## Common FlexLM Applications

FlexLM is used by many major engineering and scientific software vendors:

### ANSYS Suite
- **ANSYS Fluent**: CFD simulation software
- **ANSYS Mechanical**: Structural analysis
- **ANSYS Maxwell**: Electromagnetic field simulation
- **ANSYS HFSS**: High-frequency electromagnetic simulation

### Autodesk Products
- **AutoCAD**: Computer-aided design
- **Inventor**: 3D mechanical design
- **Maya**: 3D animation and modeling

### Other Major Applications
- **MATLAB**: Technical computing platform
- **Abaqus**: Finite element analysis
- **LS-DYNA**: Explicit dynamic simulation
- **Cadence tools**: Electronic design automation

## Getting Started with Vantage

### Quick Setup Guide

1. **Add FlexLM Server to Vantage**
   ```bash
   vantage licenses add flexlm-server \
     --host license-server.company.com \
     --port 27000 \
     --vendor ansyslmd \
     --name "ANSYS License Server"
   ```

2. **Verify Connection**
   ```bash
   vantage licenses test flexlm-server
   ```

3. **Enable Monitoring**
   ```bash
   vantage licenses monitor flexlm-server --enable
   ```

4. **Access Dashboard**
   Navigate to the Vantage web interface and view real-time license usage under "License Management"

### Configuration for Jobs

Configure Vantage jobs to use FlexLM licenses:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch.vantage.com/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: fluent-simulation
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluent
        image: vantage/ansys-fluent:2023R1
        resources:
          requests:
            licenses:
              flexlm/FLUENT: 4  # Request 4 FLUENT licenses
          limits:
            licenses:
              flexlm/FLUENT: 8  # Maximum 8 licenses
```

## Architecture Overview

### License Server Components

FlexLM consists of several key components:

- **lmgrd**: Main license manager daemon
- **Vendor daemon**: Application-specific license server (e.g., ansyslmd)
- **License file**: Contains license definitions and server configuration
- **Client libraries**: Applications link to FlexLM client libraries

```

## License Types and Features

### Node-Locked vs Floating

- **Node-locked**: License tied to specific hardware (MAC address, hostname)
- **Floating**: License can be used by any authorized client

### License Features

- **Counted features**: Limited number of concurrent users
- **Uncounted features**: Unlimited concurrent usage
- **Borrowed licenses**: Temporary checkout for offline use
- **Reserved licenses**: Guaranteed allocation for specific users/groups

### Example License File Structure

```bash
# Server definitions
SERVER license1.company.com 001122334455 27000
SERVER license2.company.com 002233445566 27000

# Vendor daemon
VENDOR ansyslmd /opt/flexlm/ansyslmd

# Feature definitions
FEATURE FLUENT ansyslmd 2023.1000 permanent 50 \
    VENDOR_STRING=ANSYS \
    HOSTID=ANY \
    SIGN=60B459C90C71

FEATURE CFX ansyslmd 2023.1000 permanent 25 \
    VENDOR_STRING=ANSYS \
    HOSTID=ANY \
    SIGN=50A348B80B62
```

## Best Practices
