Welcome to the on-premise cluster tutorials. These guides will walk you through creating, managing, and sharing clusters on your own infrastructure using Vantage's comprehensive on-premise deployment capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

In these on-premise tutorials, you'll master:

- **Infrastructure Integration** - Connect your existing hardware and data center infrastructure with Vantage
- **Hybrid Deployment** - Seamlessly integrate on-premise clusters with cloud resources
- **Security and Compliance** - Maintain complete control over data sovereignty and security policies
- **Cost Optimization** - Maximize utilization of existing infrastructure investments
- **Custom Configuration** - Tailor clusters to your specific hardware and organizational requirements

## On-Premise Advantages

### Complete Control

Maintain full control over your computing environment:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep sensitive data within your organization's boundaries
- **Security Policies**: Implement custom security configurations and compliance requirements
- **Hardware Optimization**: Utilize specialized hardware and custom configurations
- **Network Control**: Manage network topology and security according to your standards

### Cost Efficiency

Maximize your infrastructure investments:

- **Existing Hardware Utilization**: Leverage current infrastructure investments
- **Predictable Costs**: Avoid variable cloud pricing with fixed infrastructure costs
- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize resource allocation for your specific workloads
- **Energy Efficiency**: Control power consumption and cooling strategies

### Performance Optimization

Achieve optimal performance for your workloads:

- **Low Latency**: Minimize data transfer latency with local data storage
- **High Bandwidth**: Utilize internal network capabilities for data-intensive workloads
- **Custom Hardware**: Deploy specialized hardware for specific computational needs
- **Dedicated Resources**: Ensure consistent performance without resource contention

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should:

- Have physical servers or virtual infrastructure available for cluster deployment
- Network connectivity and proper firewall configurations
- Administrative access to your infrastructure and networking equipment
- Understanding of your organization's security and compliance requirements
- Basic knowledge of Linux system administration and networking concepts

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Hardware Specifications

Minimum recommended specifications for on-premise clusters:

- **Compute Nodes**: Modern multi-core processors with adequate RAM
- **Network Infrastructure**: Gigabit Ethernet minimum, 10GbE recommended
- **Storage**: Shared storage system or distributed storage capability
- **Management Network**: Dedicated management network for cluster administration

### Software Prerequisites

Required software components:

- **Operating System**: Supported Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL)
- **Container Runtime**: Docker or Podman for containerized workloads
- **Network Management**: DHCP, DNS, and network monitoring capabilities
- **Security Tools**: Firewalls, intrusion detection, and monitoring systems

## Tutorial Structure

Each on-premise tutorial covers essential aspects of self-hosted cluster management:

1. **Introduction** - Infrastructure assessment and preparation
2. **Create a Cluster** - Step-by-step deployment on your hardware
3. **Manage Cluster** - Ongoing operations, monitoring, and maintenance
4. **Share Cluster** - Team collaboration and access management

## Deployment Models

### Bare Metal Deployment

Deploy directly on physical hardware:

- Maximum performance and resource utilization
- Complete hardware control and optimization
- Minimal virtualization overhead
- Direct access to specialized hardware features

### Virtualized Environment

Deploy on existing virtualization infrastructure:

- Resource flexibility and isolation
- Integration with existing VM management tools
- Easier backup and disaster recovery
- Dynamic resource allocation capabilities

### Hybrid Configuration

Combine on-premise and cloud resources:

- Burst to cloud during peak demand periods
- Maintain sensitive data on-premise while using cloud for processing
- Disaster recovery and backup to cloud storage
- Development/testing in cloud, production on-premise
