Learn how to create your first cluster on atNorth's sustainable infrastructure using Vantage's streamlined deployment process.

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through deploying a compute cluster on atNorth's renewable energy-powered infrastructure in Iceland or Sweden. You'll learn how to leverage their sustainable, high-performance computing capabilities while maintaining the simplicity of Vantage's management interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active atNorth partnership agreement through Vantage
- atNorth account credentials and API access
- Understanding of your sustainability and performance requirements
- Basic knowledge of Nordic data center locations and regulations

## Step 1: Configure atNorth Integration

### Connect Your atNorth Account

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Cloud Accounts** in your Vantage dashboard
2. Click **Add Cloud Account** and select **atNorth**
3. Provide your atNorth integration details:
   - API credentials and access tokens
   - Preferred data center location (Iceland or Sweden)
   - Account ID and billing information

### Verify Sustainability Metrics

Configure tracking for environmental impact:

- Carbon footprint monitoring
- Renewable energy usage verification
- Power efficiency reporting
- Sustainability compliance documentation

## Step 2: Choose Your Cluster Configuration

### Select Data Center Location

1. **Iceland Data Centers**:
   - Powered by geothermal energy
   - Natural cooling from Arctic climate
   - Strategic location for EU/US connectivity
   - Excellent for 24/7 workloads

2. **Sweden Data Centers**:
   - Hydroelectric power sources
   - Cold climate natural cooling
   - EU data sovereignty compliance
   - High-speed Nordic connectivity

### Configure Hardware Specifications

Choose configurations optimized for sustainability:

- **CPU-Optimized Nodes**: High-performance processors with power efficiency
- **GPU Compute Nodes**: AI/ML workloads with renewable power
- **Memory-Intensive Configurations**: Large memory pools for data analytics
- **Storage-Optimized Systems**: High-performance storage with energy efficiency

## Step 3: Network and Connectivity Setup

### Network Configuration

Set up networking for Nordic infrastructure:

- Configure secure VPN connections to atNorth facilities
- Set up dedicated network connections if required
- Configure firewall rules for security
- Establish monitoring and alerting connections

### Data Transfer Optimization

Optimize for Nordic locations:

- Configure data transfer protocols for latency
- Set up regional data staging if needed
- Implement compression for international transfers
- Plan for timezone considerations in operations

## Step 4: Deploy the Cluster

### Review Sustainability Impact

Before deployment, review:

- Estimated carbon footprint (should be zero with renewable energy)
- Power efficiency metrics and projections
- Cost comparison with traditional cloud providers
- Compliance with sustainability reporting requirements

### Launch Deployment

1. Click **Create Cluster** to begin deployment
2. Monitor deployment progress in Vantage dashboard
3. atNorth infrastructure provisioning begins
4. Wait for all nodes to reach operational status
5. Verify renewable energy sourcing confirmation

## Step 5: Verify Deployment and Sustainability

### Check Cluster Status

1. Navigate to **Clusters** in your Vantage dashboard
2. Verify all nodes are healthy and connected
3. Check cluster endpoints and connectivity
4. Confirm data center location and power source

### Validate Sustainability Metrics

1. Verify 100% renewable energy sourcing
2. Check power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratings
3. Review carbon footprint reporting (should be zero)
4. Confirm sustainability certification compliance

### Test Performance

1. Run initial performance benchmarks
2. Test connectivity and latency from your location
3. Verify cooling efficiency impacts on performance
4. Validate any HPC-specific optimizations

## Step 6: Optimize for Nordic Operations

### Configure Timezone Handling

Set up operations for Nordic timezones:

- Configure maintenance windows for local time
- Set up monitoring alerts for business hours
- Plan job scheduling for optimal power usage
- Consider seasonal daylight variations

### Implement Cold Climate Benefits

Leverage natural cooling advantages:

- Configure higher density workloads when beneficial
- Optimize for sustained high-performance computing
- Take advantage of consistent cooling temperatures
- Monitor thermal efficiency improvements

## Next Steps

Now that your atNorth cluster is running:

- [Manage your cluster](./manage-cluster.md) for ongoing sustainable operations
- [Share your cluster](./share-cluster.md) with team members
- Set up sustainability reporting and monitoring
- Optimize workloads for renewable energy patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connectivity Problems
