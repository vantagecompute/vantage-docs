Learn how to securely share your BuzzHPC clusters with research teams and collaborators while maintaining academic collaboration standards and research data security.

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through sharing BuzzHPC clusters with research teams, managing academic collaborations, and maintaining security standards for scientific computing environments.

## Prerequisites

- Active BuzzHPC cluster deployed through Vantage
- Understanding of research collaboration requirements
- Knowledge of academic data sharing policies
- List of research collaborators and their access needs

## Research Collaboration Access Models

### Academic Research Integration

Centralized access management for research environments:

- **Research Project Access**: Project-based resource allocation and access control
- **Institutional Collaboration**: Multi-institution research team management
- **Grant-Based Access**: Funding-aligned resource allocation and tracking
- **Publication Compliance**: Data sharing requirements for research publications

### Scientific Computing Roles

Define roles specific to research computing:

1. **Principal Investigator (PI)**:
   - Full cluster management and resource allocation
   - Grant funding and budget oversight
   - Research team management and access control
   - Publication and data sharing decisions

2. **Research Scientist/Postdoc**:
   - Advanced compute access and job management
   - Data analysis and visualization capabilities
   - Collaborative research tool access
   - Mentoring access for students and staff

3. **Graduate Student/Research Assistant**:
   - Supervised compute access with quotas
   - Learning-oriented resource allocation
   - Collaborative project participation
   - Guided research computing training

4. **External Collaborator**:
   - Limited-time project-specific access
   - Controlled data sharing and access
   - Institution-verified identity requirements
   - Compliance with data sharing agreements

## Setting Up Research Team Access

### Configure Research Project Structure

Organize access by research projects and grants:

1. **Project-Based Organization**:
   - Create project directories and resource pools
   - Assign research team members to specific projects
   - Implement grant-based cost allocation
   - Set up project-specific software environments

2. **Institutional Integration**:
   - Connect with university identity management systems
   - Implement institutional data sharing policies
   - Configure compliance with research data requirements
   - Set up inter-institutional collaboration protocols

### Research Data Sharing Controls

Implement academic data sharing standards:

1. **Data Classification and Access**:
   - Classify research data by sensitivity and sharing requirements
   - Implement access controls based on data classification
   - Configure compliance with funding agency requirements
   - Set up embargo periods for unpublished research

2. **Collaborative Research Management**:
   - Share project data with authorized collaborators
   - Implement version control for research code and data
   - Configure backup and archival for research outputs
   - Manage intellectual property and publication rights

## Research Computing Resource Management

### Grant and Funding Integration

Manage resources based on research funding:

1. **Grant-Based Allocation**:
   - Allocate compute resources by research grants
   - Track usage against grant budgets
   - Generate reports for funding agencies
   - Implement cost recovery mechanisms

2. **Resource Quotas and Limits**:
   - Set computing quotas based on research needs
   - Implement fair-share scheduling for research teams
   - Priority access for time-sensitive research
   - Manage resource conflicts between projects

### Academic Workflow Integration

Connect with research workflows and tools:

- Research data management system integration
- Laboratory notebook and documentation systems
- Version control systems for research code
- Publication and citation management tools

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Research Activity Tracking

Monitor research computing usage and productivity:

1. **Research Productivity Metrics**:
   - Publication output correlation with compute usage
   - Research milestone achievement tracking
   - Collaboration effectiveness measurement
   - Student training and development progress

2. **Compliance and Reporting**:
   - Funding agency reporting requirements
   - Institutional research compliance monitoring
   - Data sharing and publication compliance
   - International collaboration regulatory compliance

### Academic Standards Maintenance

Ensure compliance with academic and research standards:

- Research integrity and reproducibility requirements
- Data management plan implementation
- Publication and citation requirement compliance
- Collaborative research agreement adherence

## Best Practices for Research Cluster Sharing

### Academic Collaboration Excellence

- **Open Science Principles**: Support reproducible research and data sharing
- **Mentorship Integration**: Facilitate learning for students and early-career researchers
- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Enable interdisciplinary research projects
- **International Partnerships**: Support global research collaboration

### Research Data Security

- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Implement appropriate controls for sensitive research data
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Safeguard research discoveries and innovations
- **Export Control Compliance**: Manage international collaboration restrictions
- **IRB and Ethics Compliance**: Ensure human subjects and research ethics compliance
