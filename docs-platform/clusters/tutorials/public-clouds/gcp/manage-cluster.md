Learn how to effectively manage, monitor, and maintain your GCP clusters using Vantage's comprehensive management tools and Google Cloud Operations.

## Overview

This tutorial covers the essential operations for managing GCP clusters throughout their lifecycle, from day-to-day monitoring to scaling operations and maintenance tasks using Google Cloud's native tools.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active GCP cluster deployed through Vantage
- Administrative access to the cluster and GCP project
- Basic understanding of Google Cloud Operations and Compute Engine
- Familiarity with your cluster's workload patterns

## Monitoring Your Cluster

### Real-time Dashboard

Access your cluster's health through the Vantage dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Clusters** > **Your GCP Cluster**
2. Review the real-time status indicators:
   - Instance health and availability
   - CPU and memory utilization across machine types
   - Network traffic and persistent disk usage
   - Job queue status and completion rates

### Google Cloud Operations Integration

Monitor detailed metrics through Cloud Operations:

- **Instance Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network throughput
- **Managed Instance Group Metrics**: Scaling activities and health checks
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific monitoring
- **Billing Metrics**: Cost tracking with sustained use discount visibility

### Setting Up Alerts

Configure proactive monitoring:

1. Set CPU utilization thresholds (e.g., greater than 80% for 5 minutes)
2. Monitor memory usage and persistent disk space
3. Track job failure rates and queue lengths
4. Set up billing alerts for cost management with GCP budgets

## Scaling Operations

### Manual Scaling

Adjust cluster size based on current needs:

1. In the Vantage dashboard, go to **Cluster Settings**
2. Modify the **Instance Count** or **Machine Types**
3. Review the estimated cost impact including sustained use discounts
4. Apply changes and monitor managed instance group updates

### Auto Scaling Configuration

Set up dynamic scaling with managed instance groups:

1. **Scale-out Policies**: Add instances when demand increases
   - Target metrics: CPU greater than 70%, Queue length greater than 10 jobs
   - Cooldown periods to prevent oscillation
   - Maximum instance limits for cost control

2. **Scale-in Policies**: Remove instances when demand decreases
   - Target metrics: CPU less than 30%, Empty queue for 10 minutes
   - Minimum instance requirements
   - Graceful job completion handling

### Machine Type Optimization

Optimize for cost and performance:

1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Monitor resource utilization patterns
   - Identify bottlenecks (CPU, memory, network)
   - Analyze job completion times across machine types

2. **Right-sizing Recommendations**:
   - Use GCP Recommender suggestions
   - Test different machine families (N1, N2, E2, C2)
   - Consider preemptible instances for fault-tolerant workloads

## Maintenance Operations

### Software Updates

Keep your cluster secure and up-to-date:

1. **Operating System Updates**:
   - Schedule maintenance windows using managed instance groups
   - Use rolling updates to minimize downtime
   - Test updates on development clusters first

2. **Application Updates**:
   - Update job schedulers and runtime environments
   - Maintain version compatibility across instances
   - Document changes and implement rollback procedures

### Security Management

Maintain cluster security:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Regularly review IAM permissions and service accounts
   - Rotate service account keys periodically
   - Monitor access logs in Cloud Audit Logs

2. **Network Security**:
   - Update firewall rules as needed
   - Review VPC configurations and subnet security
   - Implement network segmentation with multiple subnets

### Backup and Recovery

Protect your cluster data:

1. **Configuration Backups**:
   - Export cluster configurations and deployment templates
   - Document custom settings and integrations
   - Store configurations in Cloud Source Repositories

2. **Data Backups**:
   - Set up automated persistent disk snapshots
   - Configure cross-region snapshot replication
   - Test recovery procedures regularly with snapshot restoration

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation

Optimize resource usage:

1. **Job Scheduling**:
   - Configure job priorities and resource limits
   - Implement fair-share scheduling policies
   - Optimize job placement strategies across zones

2. **Storage Performance**:
   - Use appropriate persistent disk types (SSD vs Standard)
   - Configure local SSD for high I/O workloads
   - Implement data lifecycle policies with Cloud Storage

### Cost Optimization

Manage cluster costs effectively:

1. **Instance Management**:
   - Use preemptible instances for non-critical workloads (up to 80% savings)
   - Schedule clusters for business hours only
   - Implement automated shutdown policies

2. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Use Cloud Storage for long-term data archival
   - Implement data compression and deduplication
   - Clean up temporary files and snapshots regularly

3. **Sustained Use Discounts**:
   - Monitor sustained use discount eligibility
   - Optimize instance usage patterns for maximum discounts
   - Consider committed use contracts for predictable workloads

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Problems

#### High CPU Usage

- Identify resource-intensive jobs with Cloud Operations
- Consider scaling up to larger machine types
- Optimize application code and algorithms

#### Memory Issues

- Monitor memory usage patterns and swap activity
- Adjust job memory limits and requirements
- Upgrade to memory-optimized machine types (M1, M2)

#### Network Bottlenecks

- Monitor network utilization in Cloud Operations
- Consider higher-bandwidth machine types
- Use placement policies for communication-intensive workloads

### Connectivity Issues

#### SSH Access Problems

- Verify firewall rules allow SSH from your IP ranges
- Check VPC routing and Cloud Router configuration
- Validate SSH key metadata and OS Login settings

#### Job Submission Failures

- Check job scheduler health and logs
- Verify queue configurations and resource limits
- Monitor persistent disk availability and quotas

### Quota and Billing Issues

#### Resource Quota Limits

- Monitor quotas in GCP console
- Request quota increases for additional resources
- Consider distributing workload across multiple regions

#### Unexpected Costs

- Review detailed billing reports in Cloud Billing
- Check for orphaned resources (disks, snapshots)
- Verify preemptible instance usage patterns

## Best Practices

### Daily Operations

- Review cluster health dashboards in Vantage and GCP
- Monitor cost and usage reports with sustained use tracking
- Check for security alerts and recommended updates

### Weekly Reviews

- Analyze performance trends and resource utilization
- Review and adjust auto-scaling policies
- Plan for upcoming workload changes and capacity needs

### Monthly Maintenance

- Perform security updates and patches using rolling updates
- Review and optimize costs with GCP Recommender
- Test backup and recovery procedures
- Update documentation and operational procedures
