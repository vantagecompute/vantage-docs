Learn how to effectively manage, monitor, and maintain your AWS clusters using Vantage's comprehensive management tools.

## Overview

This tutorial covers the essential operations for managing AWS clusters throughout their lifecycle, from day-to-day monitoring to scaling operations and maintenance tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active AWS cluster deployed through Vantage
- Administrative access to the cluster
- Basic understanding of AWS CloudWatch and EC2 concepts
- Familiarity with your cluster's workload patterns

## Monitoring Your Cluster

### Real-time Dashboard

Access your cluster's health through the Vantage dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Clusters** > **Your AWS Cluster**
2. Review the real-time status indicators:
   - Node health and availability
   - CPU and memory utilization
   - Network traffic and storage usage
   - Job queue status and completion rates

### AWS CloudWatch Integration

Monitor detailed metrics through CloudWatch:

- **Instance Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic
- **Auto Scaling Metrics**: Scaling activities and policies
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific monitoring
- **Billing Metrics**: Cost tracking and budget alerts

### Setting Up Alerts

Configure proactive monitoring:

1. Set CPU utilization thresholds (e.g., greater than 80% for 5 minutes)
2. Monitor memory usage and disk space
3. Track job failure rates and queue lengths
4. Set up billing alerts for cost management

## Scaling Operations

### Manual Scaling

Adjust cluster size based on current needs:

1. In the Vantage dashboard, go to **Cluster Settings**
2. Modify the **Node Count** or **Instance Types**
3. Review the estimated cost impact
4. Apply changes and monitor deployment

### Auto Scaling Configuration

Set up dynamic scaling policies:

1. **Scale-out Policies**: Add nodes when demand increases
   - Target metrics: CPU greater than 70%, Queue length greater than 10 jobs
   - Cooldown periods to prevent flapping
   - Maximum instance limits for cost control

2. **Scale-in Policies**: Remove nodes when demand decreases
   - Target metrics: CPU less than 30%, Empty queue for 10 minutes
   - Minimum instance requirements
   - Graceful job completion handling

### Instance Type Optimization

Optimize for cost and performance:

1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Monitor resource utilization patterns
   - Identify bottlenecks (CPU, memory, network)
   - Analyze job completion times

2. **Right-sizing Recommendations**:
   - Use AWS Compute Optimizer suggestions
   - Test different instance families
   - Consider spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads

## Maintenance Operations

### Software Updates

Keep your cluster secure and up-to-date:

1. **Operating System Updates**:
   - Schedule maintenance windows
   - Use rolling updates to minimize downtime
   - Test updates on non-production clusters first

2. **Application Updates**:
   - Update job schedulers and runtime environments
   - Maintain version compatibility
   - Document changes and rollback procedures

### Security Management

Maintain cluster security:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Regularly review user permissions
   - Rotate SSH keys and API credentials
   - Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

2. **Network Security**:
   - Update security group rules as needed
   - Review VPC configurations
   - Implement network segmentation

### Backup and Recovery

Protect your cluster data:

1. **Configuration Backups**:
   - Export cluster configurations
   - Document custom settings and integrations
   - Store backups in version control

2. **Data Backups**:
   - Set up automated EBS snapshots
   - Configure cross-region backup replication
   - Test recovery procedures regularly

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation

Optimize resource usage:

1. **Job Scheduling**:
   - Configure job priorities and resource limits
   - Implement fair-share scheduling
   - Optimize job placement strategies

2. **Storage Performance**:
   - Use appropriate EBS volume types
   - Configure RAID arrays for high I/O workloads
   - Implement data lifecycle policies

### Cost Optimization

Manage cluster costs effectively:

1. **Instance Management**:
   - Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
   - Schedule clusters for business hours only
   - Implement automated shutdown policies

2. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Use S3 for long-term data storage
   - Implement data compression and deduplication
   - Clean up temporary files regularly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Problems

#### High CPU Usage

- Identify resource-intensive jobs
- Consider scaling up or out
- Optimize application code and algorithms

#### Memory Issues

- Monitor swap usage and out-of-memory events
- Adjust job memory limits
- Upgrade to memory-optimized instances

#### Network Bottlenecks

- Monitor network utilization
- Use enhanced networking features
- Consider placement groups for HPC workloads

### Connectivity Issues

#### SSH Access Problems

- Verify security group configurations
- Check VPC routing and internet gateway
- Validate SSH key permissions

#### Job Submission Failures

- Check job scheduler health
- Verify queue configurations
- Monitor storage availability

## Best Practices

### Daily Operations

- Review cluster health dashboards
- Monitor cost and usage reports
- Check for security alerts and updates

### Weekly Reviews

- Analyze performance trends and patterns
- Review and adjust scaling policies
- Plan for upcoming workload changes

### Monthly Maintenance

- Perform security updates and patches
- Review and optimize costs
- Test backup and recovery procedures
- Update documentation and procedures

## Next Steps

Continue improving your cluster management:

- [Share your cluster](./share-cluster.md) with team members
- Implement advanced monitoring with custom metrics
- Set up disaster recovery procedures
- Explore multi-region deployments
