---

Learn how to deploy, configure, and manage compute clusters across different environments using Vantage Compute. These tutorials will guide you through real-world scenarios from basic cluster setup to advanced multi-cloud configurations.

## Cluster Types and Deployment Options

Vantage Compute supports three main categories of cluster deployment:

### On-Premises Clusters

Deploy and manage clusters on your own infrastructure:

- **Bare Metal**: Direct hardware integration for maximum performance
- **Private Cloud**: Virtualized environments with dedicated resources
- **Hybrid Configurations**: Combine on-premises with cloud burst capabilities

### Public Cloud Clusters

Leverage major cloud providers for scalable compute resources:

- **AWS**: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances with spot pricing
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Compute Engine with preemptible instances
- **Microsoft Azure**: Virtual machines with flexible scaling options

### Vantage Partner Clusters

Access specialized compute resources through Vantage partners:

- **atNorth**: High-performance computing in Iceland with renewable energy
- **BuzzHPC**: Academic and research computing solutions
- **Responsible Compute**: Sustainable computing with carbon offset options
- **CUDO Compute**: Distributed computing network with global reach
