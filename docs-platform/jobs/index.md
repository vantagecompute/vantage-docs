description: High Performance Computing job management with Vantage
---

Vantage provides powerful job management capabilities for High Performance Computing workloads. Create, manage, and track your computational jobs with ease.

## Popular Workflows

- **Scientific Computing**: Run simulations and data analysis workloads
- **Machine Learning**: Train models on distributed computing infrastructure  
- **Engineering**: Execute CAD/CAE simulations and optimization studies
- **Research**: Process large datasets and run complex calculations

The Vantage platform provides lifecycle primitives for job-scripts, job-templates, and job-submissions.

Follow the documentation links below to take a deeper dive into Jobs.

## Scripts

Develop and share custom job scripts with version control and collaboration features.

Job Scripts in Vantage represent slurm batch scripts. This means that you can import your existing batch scripts
to Vantage and run your workloads in the way you are already familiar.

## Templates

Create reusable job templates that standardize common computational workflows across your organization.

Job Templates are an abstraction layer on Job Script creation. Define a set of questions and template files that
enable your team drive predefined workflows without touching the cli.
