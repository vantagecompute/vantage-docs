The Vantage platform provites lifecycle and collaboration for job-scripts, job-templates, and job-submissions.

## Access Methods

You can submit, monitor, and manage jobs using several powerful interfaces:

### 1. Vantage Web UI

The Vantage Web UI offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface for:

- Submitting new jobs to any connected cluster
- Monitoring job status and logs in real time
- Managing job templates and job history
- Visualizing resource usage and job outcomes

### 2. jobbergate-cli (Command Line Interface)

For users who prefer the command line, the [jobbergate-cli](https://pypi.org/project/jobbergate-cli/) tool provides:

- Job submission and management directly from your terminal
- Automation of batch job workflows
- Integration with scripts and CI/CD pipelines

Install with:

```bash
pip install jobbergate-cli
```

See the [jobbergate-cli documentation](https://pypi.org/project/jobbergate-cli/) for usage examples.

### 3. Vantage Compute API

Advanced users and developers can interact with jobs programmatically using the [Vantage Compute Jobbergate API](https://apis.vantagecompute.ai/jobbergate/docs):

- Submit, query, and manage jobs via REST endpoints
- Integrate Vantage with external systems and custom applications
- Automate complex workflows at scale

Explore the [API documentation](https://apis.vantagecompute.ai/jobbergate/docs) for details and code samples.

### 4. jobbergate-core Python Library

For Python developers, the [jobbergate-core](https://pypi.org/project/jobbergate-core/) library enables:

- Programmatic job submission and management from Python scripts
- Building custom job templates and automation tools
- Deep integration with scientific and engineering workflows
