Job templates in Vantage provide a powerful way to standardize and streamline job submission processes. By creating reusable templates, you can ensure consistency across your organization while reducing the complexity of job configuration.

## What are Job Templates?

Job templates are pre-configured job definitions that include:

- **Resource Requirements**: CPU, memory, and GPU specifications
- **Environment Settings**: Software modules, environment variables, and dependencies
- **Input/Output Configuration**: Data paths, file handling, and result storage
- **Queue Parameters**: Priority settings, time limits, and scheduling preferences

## Benefits of Using Templates

### Consistency

Templates ensure that jobs are configured consistently across different users and projects, reducing configuration errors and improving reproducibility.

### Efficiency

Pre-defined templates eliminate the need to specify common parameters repeatedly, making job submission faster and more efficient.

### Best Practices

Templates can encode organizational best practices and optimized configurations, helping users achieve better performance and resource utilization.

### Collaboration

Shared templates facilitate collaboration by providing a common framework for job submission across teams and projects.

## Template Types

Vantage supports several types of job templates:

### Application Templates

Pre-configured templates for specific applications like:

- Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

- Engineering software (ANSYS, Abaqus)

### Workflow Templates

Templates for complex multi-step workflows:

- Data processing pipelines
- Parameter sweeps and optimization
- Multi-stage simulations

### Custom Templates

Organization-specific templates tailored to your unique requirements and workflows.
