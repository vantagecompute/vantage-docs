Archiving job scripts in Vantage provides long-term storage and organization for completed or inactive computational workflows. This guide covers strategies for effective script archival and retrieval, ensuring historical preservation and future accessibility.

## Overview

Script archiving is a critical component of computational workflow management that:

- **Preserves Historical Work**: Maintains records of completed computations for future reference
- **Reduces Active Storage**: Moves inactive scripts to long-term storage to optimize workspace
- **Maintains Compliance**: Ensures regulatory and institutional data retention requirements are met
- **Enables Reproducibility**: Preserves the exact computational environment and code for future replication
- **Supports Auditing**: Provides traceable records of computational processes and decisions

## When to Archive Scripts

Consider archiving scripts in these scenarios:

### Completed Projects

- **Finished Research**: Scripts from completed studies or analysis projects
- **Published Results**: Scripts used to generate published or reported findings
- **Milestone Deliverables**: Scripts that completed specific project phases

### Duplicate Scripts

- **Functionality Overlap**: Multiple scripts performing similar tasks
- **Replaced Versions**: Older versions when newer versions are stable
- **Test Scripts**: Development and testing scripts no longer needed

## Pre-Deletion Assessment

Before deleting scripts, perform thorough assessment:

### Usage Analysis

Check script usage patterns and dependencies.

### Safety Checklist

Verify that deletion is safe and won't impact ongoing work.

## Deletion Procedures

### Archive Before Deletion

### Update Documentation

Remove references to deleted scripts from documentation.

## Best Practices

- Test thoroughly before deletion
- Maintain proper audit trails
- Coordinate with team members
